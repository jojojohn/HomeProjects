##Streams

Streams are wrappers around collections. Streams are immutable flow of elements.
1. Streams processing can be sequential or parallel. 
2. Streams will not store the elements, Once the elements are processed then they are no longer available. 
3. Stream pipeline known as method chaining. 

Core stream behavior is defined in BaseStream. 
Stream, DoubleStream, LongStream, IntStream interfaces extends BaseStream.
Stream can be created from arrays, collection and also can use static methods inside Stream class.
