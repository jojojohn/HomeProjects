### Summary ranges

Given a sorted integer array without duplicates, return the sumary of its ranges for consecutive numbers.

For Example given [0,1,2,4,5,7] returns ["0->2","4->5",7]

Solution

One iteration will resolve this issue. But each iteration need to track first and end of consecutive numbers.
